Variables and memory in C++ 
loc name value type 
Stack memory 
Pointers - Intro 
Stack memory 
loc name value type 
a20 x 5 int 
a40 p int * 
int x; 
int * p; 
How do we assign to p? 
p =  
 
p =  
_________ operator:  & 
 
_________ operator:  * 
Pointer variables and dynamic memory allocation: 
Stack memory 
loc name type value 
Heap memory

type value 
a40 p int * 
int * p; 
Fun and games with pointers: (warm-up) 
int * p, q;  What type is q?______________  
 
int *p; 
int x; 
p = &x; 
*p = 6; 
cout << x;   What is output?______________  
cout << p;   What is output?______________ 
Write a statement whose output is the value of x, using variable p:  ___________ 
Fun and games with pointers:  
int *p, *q; 
p = new int; 
q = p; 
*q = 8; 
cout << *p;    What is output?______________  
q = new int; 
*q = 9; 
p = NULL;    Do you like this?_____________ 
delete q; 
q = NULL;    Do you like this?_____________ 
 
Memory leak: 
Deleting a null pointer: 
Dereferencing a null pointer: 
Fun and games with pointers: 
int * p, * q; 
p = new int; 
q = p; 
delete p; 
… // some random stuff 
cout << *q;    Do you like this?_____________
