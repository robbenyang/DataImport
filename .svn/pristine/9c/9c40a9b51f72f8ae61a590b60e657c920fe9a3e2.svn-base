Recursion
Example: Summing from n to k Let’s write a recursive function that does simple math.
Given two integers, n and k, where n  k, find the sum of integers from n to k, inclusive (e.g.,
if n = 2, and k = 4, our program will add 2 + 3 + 4)
int mySum (int n, int k) {
}
Problem 1: Computing the nth Fibonacci number
Translate the following into a recursive MIPS function.
int fib (int n) {
if (n <= 1)
return n;
else
return fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2);
}
