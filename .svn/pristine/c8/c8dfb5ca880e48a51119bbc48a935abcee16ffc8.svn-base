fork() Example 
void main() { 
   int i = 0; 
   for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
      if (!fork()) 
         break; 
} 
 
What makes up a process? 
• Operating systems manage processes in a 
structure called a process control block (PCB).  
Includes: 
– Identification information 
 
 
– Runtime information 
 
 
– Accounting information 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Threads 
• The purpose of a process is to act as a 
container of threads. 
– Threads are the “computational engine” of the 
process: they run code! 
 
– At startup: 
What makes up a threads? 
• Operating systems manage threads in a 
structure called a thread control block (TCB).  
Includes: 
– Identification information 
 
 
– Runtime information 
 
 
– Accounting information 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Modeling a Thread/Process 
• To understand the interactions of thread, 
processes are modeled using a state diagram. 
– For a process with only one thread, this also 
models the entire process 
 
• Two-State Model: 
Five-State Model 
Two process, each with 1 thread One process with two threads
