Important Characteristics of Structured Data 
 Dimensionality 
 Curse of dimensionality 
 Sparsity 
 Only presence counts 
 Resolution 
 Patterns depend on the scale  
 Distribution 
 Centrality and dispersion 
6 
Data Objects 
 Data sets are made up of data objects. 
 A data object represents an entity. 
 Examples:  
 sales database:  customers, store items, sales 
 medical database: patients, treatments 
 university database: students, professors, courses 
 Also called samples , examples, instances, data points, objects, 
tuples. 
 Data objects are described by attributes. 
 Database rows -> data objects; columns ->attributes. 
7 
Attributes 
 Attribute (or dimensions, features, variables): a data 
field, representing a characteristic or feature of a data 
object. 
 E.g., customer _ID, name, address 
 Types: 
 Nominal 
 Binary 
 Numeric: quantitative 
 Interval-scaled 
 Ratio-scaled 
8 
Attribute Types  
 Nominal: categories, states, or “names of things” 
 Hair_color = {auburn, black, blond, brown, grey, red, white} 
 marital status, occupation, ID numbers, zip codes 
 Binary 
 Nominal attribute with only 2 states (0 and 1) 
 Symmetric binary: both outcomes equally important 
 e.g., gender 
 Asymmetric binary: outcomes not equally important.   
 e.g., medical test (positive vs. negative) 
 Convention: assign 1 to most important outcome (e.g., HIV 
positive) 
 Ordinal 
 Values have a meaningful order (ranking) but magnitude between 
successive values is not known. 
 Size = {small, medium, large}, grades, army rankings 
9 
Numeric Attribute Types  
 Quantity (integer or real-valued) 
 Interval 
 Measured on a scale of equal-sized units 
 Values have order 
 E.g., temperature in C˚or F˚, calendar dates 
 No true zero-point 
 Ratio 
 Inherent zero-point 
 We can speak of values as being an order of magnitude 
larger than the unit of measurement (10 K˚ is twice as 
high as 5 K˚). 
 e.g., temperature in Kelvin, length, counts, 
monetary quantities 
10 
Discrete vs. Continuous Attributes  
 Discrete Attribute 
 Has only a finite or countably infinite set of values 
 E.g., zip codes, profession, or the set of words in a 
collection of documents  
 Sometimes, represented as integer variables 
 Note: Binary attributes are a special case of discrete 
attributes  
 Continuous Attribute 
 Has real numbers as attribute values 
 E.g., temperature, height, or weight 
 Practically, real values can only be measured and 
represented using a finite number of digits 
 Continuous attributes are typically represented as floating-
point variables

Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data 
 Motivation 
 To better understand the data: central tendency, variation 
and spread 
 Data dispersion characteristics  
 median, max, min, quantiles, outliers, variance, etc. 
 Numerical dimensions correspond to sorted intervals 
 Data dispersion: analyzed with multiple granularities of 
precision 
 Boxplot or quantile analysis on sorted intervals 
 Dispersion analysis on computed measures 
 Folding measures into numerical dimensions 
 Boxplot or quantile analysis on the transformed cube 
13 
Measuring the Central Tendency 
 Mean (algebraic measure) (sample vs. population): 
Note: n is sample size and N is population size.  
 Weighted arithmetic mean: 
 Trimmed mean: chopping extreme values 
 Median:  
 Middle value if odd number of values, or average of the 
middle two values otherwise 
 Estimated by interpolation (for grouped data): 
 
 Mode 
 Value that occurs most frequently in the data 
 Unimodal, bimodal, trimodal 
 Empirical formula:

 Symmetric vs. Skewed Data 
 Median, mean and mode of 
symmetric, positively and negatively 
skewed data 
positively skewed negatively skewed 
symmetric 
15 
Measuring the Dispersion of Data 
 Quartiles, outliers and boxplots 
 Quartiles: Q1 (25th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile) 
 Inter-quartile range: IQR = Q3 – Q1  
 Five number summary: min, Q1, median, Q3, max 
 Boxplot: ends of the box are the quartiles; median is marked; add whiskers, 
and plot outliers individually 
 Outlier: usually, a value higher/lower than 1.5 x IQR 
 Variance and standard deviation (sample: s, population: σ) 
 Variance: (algebraic, scalable computation) 
 
 
 Standard deviation s (or σ) is the square root of variance s2 (or σ2)

 Boxplot Analysis 
 Five-number summary of a distribution 
 Minimum, Q1, Median, Q3, Maximum 
 Boxplot 
 Data is represented with a box 
 The ends of the box are at the first and third 
quartiles, i.e., the height of the box is IQR 
 The median is marked by a line within the box 
 Whiskers: two lines outside the box extended 
to Minimum and Maximum 
 Outliers: points beyond a specified outlier 
threshold, plotted individually

Properties of Normal Distribution Curve 
 The normal (distribution) curve 
 From μ–σ to μ+σ: contains about 68% of the measurements  
(μ: mean, σ: standard deviation) 
  From μ–2σ to μ+2σ: contains about 95% of it 
 From μ–3σ to μ+3σ: contains about 99.7% of it 
 
 
19 
Graphic Displays of Basic Statistical Descriptions 
 Boxplot: graphic display of five-number summary 
 Histogram: x-axis are values, y-axis repres. frequencies  
 Quantile plot:  each value xi  is paired with fi  indicating that 
approximately 100 fi % of data  are ≤ xi  
 Quantile-quantile (q-q) plot: graphs the quantiles of one 
univariant distribution against the corresponding quantiles of 
another 
 Scatter plot: each pair of values is a pair of coordinates and 
plotted as points in the plane 
20 
Histogram Analysis 
 Histogram: Graph display of tabulated 
frequencies, shown as bars 
 It shows what proportion of cases fall 
into each of several categories 
 Differs from a bar chart in that it is 
the area of the bar that denotes the 
value, not the height as in bar charts, 
a crucial distinction when the 
categories are not of uniform width 
 The categories are usually specified as 
non-overlapping intervals of some 
variable. The categories (bars) must 
be adjacent

Histograms Often Tell More than Boxplots 
 The two histograms 
shown in the left may 
have the same boxplot 
representation 
 The same values for: 
min, Q1, median, Q3, 
max 
 But they have rather 
different data 
distributions 
Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques 22 
Quantile Plot 
 Displays all of the data (allowing the user to assess both the 
overall behavior and unusual occurrences) 
 Plots quantile information 
 For a data xi data sorted in increasing order, fi indicates that 
approximately 100 fi% of the data are below or equal to the 
value xi 
23 
Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot 
 Graphs the quantiles of one univariate distribution against the 
corresponding quantiles of another 
 View: Is there is a shift in going from one distribution to another? 
 Example shows unit price of items sold at Branch 1 vs. Branch 2 for 
each quantile.  Unit prices of items sold at Branch 1 tend to be lower 
than those at Branch 2. 
24 
Scatter plot 
 Provides a first look at bivariate data to see clusters of points, 
outliers, etc 
 Each pair of values is treated as a pair of coordinates and 
plotted as points in the plane 
25 
Positively and Negatively Correlated Data 
 The left half fragment is positively 
correlated 
 The right half is negative correlated 
26 
 Uncorrelated Data

29 
Pixel-Oriented Visualization Techniques 
 For a data set of m dimensions, create m windows on the screen, one 
for each dimension 
 The m dimension values of a record are mapped to m pixels at the 
corresponding positions in the windows 
 The colors of the pixels reflect the corresponding values 
(a) Income (b) Credit Limit (c) transaction volume (d) age 
30 
Laying Out Pixels in Circle Segments 
 To save space and show the connections among multiple dimensions, 
space filling is often done in a circle segment

Landscapes 
 Visualization of the data as perspective landscape 
 The data needs to be transformed into a (possibly artificial) 2D spatial 
representation which preserves the characteristics of the data  
35 
Parallel Coordinates 
 n equidistant axes which are parallel to one of the screen axes and 
correspond to the attributes  
 The axes are scaled to the [minimum, maximum]: range of the 
corresponding attribute 
 Every data item corresponds to a polygonal line which intersects each of the 
axes at the point which corresponds to the value for the attribute 
36 
Parallel Coordinates of a Data Set 
37 
Icon-Based Visualization Techniques 
 Visualization of the data values as features of icons 
 Typical visualization methods 
 Chernoff Faces 
 Stick Figures 
 General techniques 
 Shape coding: Use shape to represent certain information 
encoding 
 Color icons: Use color icons to encode more information 
 Tile bars: Use small icons to represent the relevant feature 
vectors in document retrieval 
38 
Chernoff Faces 
 A way to display variables on a two-dimensional surface, e.g., let x be 
eyebrow slant, y be eye size, z be nose length, etc.  
 The figure shows faces produced using 10 characteristics--head eccentricity, 
eye size, eye spacing, eye eccentricity, pupil size, eyebrow slant, nose size, 
mouth shape, mouth size, and mouth opening): Each assigned one of 10 
possible values, generated using Mathematica (S. Dickson)

Hierarchical Visualization Techniques 
 Visualization of the data using a hierarchical 
partitioning into subspaces 
 Methods 
 Dimensional Stacking 
 Worlds-within-Worlds 
 Tree-Map  
 Cone Trees 
 InfoCube 
41 
Dimensional Stacking 
 Partitioning of the n-dimensional attribute space in 2-D 
subspaces, which are ‘stacked’ into each other 
 Partitioning of the attribute value ranges into classes.  The 
important attributes should be used on the outer levels. 
 Adequate for data with ordinal attributes of low cardinality 
 But, difficult to display more than nine dimensions 
 Important to map dimensions appropriately

Dimensional Stacking 
43 
Worlds-within-Worlds 
 Assign the function and two most important parameters to innermost 
world  
 Fix all other parameters at constant values - draw other (1 or 2 or 3 
dimensional worlds choosing these as the axes) 
 Software that uses this paradigm 
 N–vision: Dynamic 
interaction through data 
glove and stereo displays, 
including  rotation, scaling 
(inner) and translation 
(inner/outer)  
 Auto Visual: Static 
interaction by means of 
queries 
44 
Tree-Map 
 Screen-filling method which uses a hierarchical partitioning of 
the screen into regions depending on the attribute values 
 The x- and y-dimension of the screen are partitioned alternately 
according to the attribute values (classes)

large data sets of a million items  
45 
InfoCube 
 A 3-D visualization technique where hierarchical 
information is displayed as nested semi-transparent 
cubes  
 The outermost cubes correspond to the top level data, 
while the subnodes or the lower level data are 
represented as smaller cubes inside the outermost 
cubes, and so on 
46 
Three-D Cone Trees 
 3D cone tree visualization technique works 
well for up to a thousand nodes or so 
 First build a 2D circle tree that arranges its 
nodes in concentric circles centered on the 
root node 
 Cannot avoid overlaps when projected to 2D

Trees: Animated 3D Visualizations of 
Hierarchical Information”, ACM SIGCHI'91 
 Graph from Nadeau Software Consulting 
website: Visualize a social network data set 
that models the way an infection spreads from 
one person to the next  
Visualizing Complex Data and Relations 
 Visualizing non-numerical data: text and social networks 
 Tag cloud: visualizing user-generated tags 
 The importance of tag is 
represented by font 
size/color 
 Besides text data, there are 
also methods to visualize 
relationships, such as 
visualizing social networks

Standardizing Numeric Data 
 Z-score:  
 X: raw score to be standardized, μ: mean of the population, σ: standard 
deviation 
 the distance between the raw score and the population mean in units 
of the standard deviation 
 negative when the raw score is below the mean, “+” when above 
 An alternative way: Calculate the mean absolute deviation 
 
where 
 
 standardized measure (z-score): 
 Using mean absolute deviation is more robust than using standard 
deviation

Distance on Numeric Data: Minkowski Distance 
 Minkowski distance: A popular distance measure 
 
 
where  i = (xi1, xi2, …, xip) and j = (xj1, xj2, …, xjp) are two p-
dimensional data objects, and h is the order (the distance 
so defined is also called L-h norm) 
 Properties 
 d(i, j) > 0 if i ≠ j, and d(i, i) = 0 (Positive definiteness) 
 d(i, j) = d(j, i)  (Symmetry) 
 d(i, j) ≤ d(i, k) + d(k, j)  (Triangle Inequality) 
 A distance that satisfies these properties is a metric 
57 
Special Cases of Minkowski Distance 
 h = 1:  Manhattan (city block, L1 norm) distance  
 E.g., the Hamming distance: the number of bits that are different 
between two binary vectors 
 
 
 h = 2:  (L2 norm) Euclidean distance 
 
 
 h → ∞.  “supremum” (Lmax norm, L∞ norm) distance.  
 This is the maximum difference between any component (attribute) 
of the vectors

Ordinal Variables 
 An ordinal variable can be discrete or continuous 
 Order is important, e.g., rank 
 Can be treated like interval-scaled  
 replace xif  by their rank  
 map the range of each variable onto [0, 1] by replacing i-th 
object in the f-th variable by 
 
 
 compute the dissimilarity using methods for interval-scaled 
variables

Attributes of Mixed Type 
 A database may contain all attribute types 
 Nominal, symmetric binary, asymmetric binary, numeric, 
ordinal 
 One may use a weighted formula to combine their effects

dij(f) = 0  if xif = xjf , or dij(f) = 1 otherwise 
 f  is numeric: use the normalized distance 
 f  is ordinal  
 Compute ranks rif and

 Cosine Similarity 
 
 A document can be represented by thousands of attributes, each recording the 
frequency of a particular word (such as keywords) or phrase in the document. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Other vector objects: gene features in micro-arrays, … 
 Applications: information retrieval, biologic taxonomy, gene feature mapping, 
... 
 Cosine measure: If d1 and d2 are two vectors (e.g., term-frequency vectors), 
then 
             cos(d1, d2) =  (d1 • d2) /||d1|| ||d2|| ,  
   where • indicates vector dot product, ||d||: the length of vector d 
62 
 Example: Cosine Similarity 
 
 cos(d1, d2) =  (d1 • d2) /||d1|| ||d2|| ,  
   where • indicates vector dot product, ||d|: the length of vector d 
 
 Ex: Find the similarity between documents 1 and 2. 
 
d1 =  (5, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0) 
d2 =  (3, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1) 
 
d1•d2 = 5*3+0*0+3*2+0*0+2*1+0*1+0*1+2*1+0*0+0*1 = 25 
||d1||= (5*5+0*0+3*3+0*0+2*2+0*0+0*0+2*2+0*0+0*0)0.5=(42)0.5  = 6.481 
||d2||= (3*3+0*0+2*2+0*0+1*1+1*1+0*0+1*1+0*0+1*1)0.5=(17)0.5       = 4.12 
cos(d1, d2 ) = 0.94

 KL Divergence: Comparing Two 
Probability Distributions  
 The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence:  Measure the difference between two 
probability distributions over the same variable x 
 From information theory, closely related to relative entropy, information 
divergence, and information for discrimination 
 DKL(p(x) || q(x)):  divergence of q(x) from p(x), measuring the information lost 
when q(x) is used to approximate p(x) 
 Discrete form: 
 
 The KL divergence measures the expected number of extra bits required to 
code samples from p(x) (“true” distribution) when using a code based on q(x), 
which represents a theory, model, description, or approximation of p(x) 
 Its continuous form: 
 
 The KL divergence: not a distance measure, not a metric: asymmetric, not 
satisfy triangular inequality

 How to Compute the 
KL Divergence? 
 Base on the formula, DKL(P,Q) ≥ 0 and DKL(P || Q) = 0 if and only if P = Q. 
 How about when p = 0 or q = 0? 
 limp→0 p log p = 0 
 when p != 0 but q = 0, DKL(p || q) is defined as ∞, i.e., if one event e is 
possible (i.e., p(e) > 0), and the other predicts it is absolutely impossible 
(i.e., q(e) = 0), then the two distributions are absolutely different 
 However, in practice, P and Q are derived from frequency distributions, not 
counting the possibility of unseen events. Thus smoothing is needed 
 Example: P : (a : 3/5, b : 1/5, c : 1/5).  Q : (a : 5/9, b : 3/9, d : 1/9) 
 need to introduce a small constant ϵ, e.g., ϵ = 10−3 
 The sample set observed in P, SP = {a, b, c},  SQ = {a, b, d},  SU = {a, b, c, d} 
 Smoothing, add missing symbols to each distribution, with probability ϵ  
 P′ : (a : 3/5 − ϵ/3, b : 1/5 − ϵ/3, c : 1/5 − ϵ/3, d : ϵ)  
 Q′ : (a : 5/9 − ϵ/3, b : 3/9 − ϵ/3, c : ϵ, d : 1/9 − ϵ/3).  
 DKL(P’ || Q’) can be computed easily
