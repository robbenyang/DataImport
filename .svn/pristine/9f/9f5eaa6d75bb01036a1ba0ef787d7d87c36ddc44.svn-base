These questions are provided to you to help you study material covered in CS 241 that may appear on the

almost certainly be on the final exam. 
1. What are the four conditions of deadlock? 
 
2. Choose two of the conditions of deadlock you identified in (1). For each method chosen, provide 
a set or rules for the philosophers in the Dinning Philosophers Problem that removes the deadlock

5. Run the Bankerâ€™s Algorithm to determine if a request made by P1 for (A: 2, B: 2, C: 2) can be 
allocated.  The maximum available resources in the system are (A: 10, B: 5, C: 5) and the current 
and maximums (written as current / maximum) resources for each process in the system are as 
follows: 
 A B C 
P1 0 / 7 1 / 5 0 / 3 
P2 2 / 3 0 / 2 0 / 2 
P3 3 / 9 0 / 0 0 / 2 
P4 2 / 2 1 / 2 1 / 2 
P5 0 / 4 0 / 3 2 / 3
