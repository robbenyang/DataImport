Week #10: Pipes and mmaps 
Exam Review Question  
CS 241: Fall 2013 
These questions are provided to you to help you study material covered in CS 241 that may appear on the 
final exam.  These exact questions may or may not appear on the final exam, but the topics they cover will 
almost certainly be on the final exam. 
1. Consider the code below: 
int main() { 
  int *ptr = mmap(NULL, 
                  sizeof(int), 
                  PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, 
                  MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, 
                  -1, 
                  0); 
 
  *ptr = 0; 
  fork(); 
  (*ptr)++; 
 
  printf("The value is: %d\n", *ptr); 
} 
 
What all is printed out after the program is executed? 
 
2. The pipe() system call takes in an array of two integers, returning two file descriptors.  How 
do the two returned file descriptors differ?  How should they be used? 
 
3. Synchronization (such as mutexes, semaphores, or conditional variables) are often not used with 
pipes.  Why?  
 
4. When is synchronization required when using a mmap? 
 
5. Explain why a pipe cannot be used in all instances.  Give an example when a different form of 
stream-based IPC must be used because a pipe cannot be used.
