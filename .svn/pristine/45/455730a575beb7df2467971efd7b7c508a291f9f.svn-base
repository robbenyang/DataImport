#1(e) 
• Example file system: 
– Each i-node contains 10 direct, 1 SI, 1 DI, 1 TI 
– Each disk block is 4 KB is size 
– Each disk pointer is 8 B long 
 
• Detail how a 10 MB file would be stored? 
#1(f) 
• What is the maximum addressable size of the  
file system? 
#1(g) 
• How much space does a 1 byte file take up?
