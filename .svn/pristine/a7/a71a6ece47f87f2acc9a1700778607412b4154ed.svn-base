These questions are provided to you to help you study material covered in CS 241 that may appear on the 
final exam.  These exact questions may or may not appear on the final exam, but the topics they cover will 
almost certainly be on the final exam. 
1. What is the maximum size of a file that can be stored in an i-node based file system where the 
size of each disk block is 8 KB, the size of a disk pointer is 4 B, and each i-node contains 5 direct 
entries, 3 single-indirect entries, 2 double-indirect entries, and 1 triple-indirect entry? 
 
2. If the size of a disk pointer doubles, how does this affect the maximum size of the file on a 
system where each i-node contains 10 direct entires, 1 single-, 1 double-, and 1 triple-indirect 
entry? 
a. Does the maximum size grow by a factor of 2x (eg: doubles)?  
b. Does the maximum file size shrink by a factor of 0.5x (eg: the new maximum file size is 
half of the old size)? 
c. What is the new maximum file size as a factor to the old maximum file size? 
 
3. Name three things that are included in an i-node entry and one thing that is not contained in an i-
