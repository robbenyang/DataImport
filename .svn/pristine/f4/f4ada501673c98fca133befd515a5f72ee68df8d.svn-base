MP6 available, due 11/19, 11:59p.  EC due 11/12, 11:59p.
Today’s announcements:
Cliff Hangers...
•Linear Probing -> removal
•Linear Probing -> bigger step sizes
•What if array fills?
•Hashing O(1)?

Probe based hashing – 2 problems…
Removals: {8, 16, 29, 22} Clustering:

Probe based hashing:  (double hashing)
S = {16, 8, 4, 13, 29, 11, 22}     |S| = n   H(k,i) = h1(k) + ih2(k)

Hash table performance:  expected # of probes for Find(key) under SUHA
Linear probing - 
Separate chaining -
Double hashing -

½ (1 + 1/(1-α))
½ (1 + 1/(1-α))2
1/α ln 1/(1-α)
1/(1-α)
1 +α/2 
1 +α
Do not memorize these!
Observe:
•As α increases, running times 
increase…
•If α is held constant then 
running times are constant…
Which is better?
•Big records – 
•Structure speed – 
What structures do hash 
tables replace for us?

ReHashing:
What if the array fills?
Miscellaneous Discussion – 
Which hash table implementation is better?
•Big records –  
•Structure speed – 
What structures do hash tables replace for us?
Why do we talk about balanced BST if hashing is so great?
Applications of hashing?  
Area of active research in mathematics to develop general purpose hash functions.
Interview questions!
Consider a stream of integers... you want to know immediately if the stream stops 
producing unique values.
Consider a stream of integers... you want to know immediately if you have seen a 
pair of numbers that sum to 225.
