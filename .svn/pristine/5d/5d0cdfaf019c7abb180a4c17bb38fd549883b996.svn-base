How do we interact with the OS? 
• System Calls allows an application to access a 
OS-managed resource 
– OS-managed resources can only be accessed in a 
privileged “kernel” level 
 
Programmer’s View 
• Three types of function calls: 
– (Application) Function call 
 
 
– Library function call 
 
 
– System calls / syscall()

Library Function Calls 
System Calls 
10 
count = read (fd, buffer, nbytes); 
System Calls 
• Almost all system calls fit within five broad 
categories: 
– Process Control 
– File Management 
– Device Management 
– Information Management 
– Communication 
 
System Calls 
• Process Control 
– fork(): Creates a child process 
– exec(): Execute a new process image 
– kill(): Terminate/signal a process 
– wait(): Wait for a process to complete 
– sbrk(): Increase process’ heap size 
– … 
 
System Calls 
• File Management 
– open(): Opens a file 
– close(): Closes a file 
– read(): Reads from a file 
– write(): Writes to a file 
– lseek(): Seek within a file 
– … 
 
System Calls 
• Device Management 
– mkdir(): Makes a directory 
– rmdir(): Removes an empty directory 
– link(): Creates a link to a file/directory 
– unlink(): Removes the link 
– mount(): Mount a device/file system 
– unmount(): Removes the mount 
– … 
 
System Calls 
• Information Management 
– stat(): Get status of a file/directory 
– times(): Process running times 
– getrusage(): Resource usage 
– clock_gettime(): Get system time 
– clock_getres(): Clock resolution 
– … 
 
System Calls 
• Communication 
– pipe(): Communicate b/t two processes 
– shmget(): Share memory b/t processes 
– mmap(): Maps virtual memory 
– socket(): Network socket 
– connect(): Connect to a remote server 
– accept(): Accept remote connection 
– send(): Send network messages 
– … 
C Library Calls 
#include <stdio.h> 
 
char *s = "Hello"; 
printf("%s\n", s);
