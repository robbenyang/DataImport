Hash Functions - Required characteristics
KeySpace

0 1 … N-1
0 1 … N-1
Hash Functions - Why can’t we avoid collisions?
And what are collisions anyway?
KeySpace 0 1 … N-1
Collision handling - Separate Chaining: (an example of open hashing)
S = {16, 8, 4, 13, 29, 11, 22}             |S| = n h(k) = k%7

Collision Handling - Probe based hashing:  (example of closed hashing)
S = {16, 8, 4, 13, 29, 11, 22}             |S| = n h(k) = k%7

Probe based hashing:  (double hashing)
S = {16, 8, 4, 13, 29, 11, 22}     |S| = n   H(k,i) = h1(k) + ih2(k)

1/α ln 1/(1-α)

1 +α/2 
1 +α
Do not memorize these!
Observe:
•As α increases, running times 
increase…
•If α is held constant then 
running times are constant…
Which is better?
•Big records – 
•Structure speed – 
What structures do hash 
tables replace for us?

ReHashing:
What if the array fills?
Miscellaneous Discussion – 
Which hash table implementation is better?
•Big records –  
•Structure speed – 
What structures do hash tables replace for us?
Why do we talk about balanced BST if hashing is so great?
Applications of hashing?  
Area of active research in mathematics to develop general purpose hash functions.
Interview questions!
Consider a stream of integers... you want to know immediately if the stream stops 
producing unique values.
Consider a stream of integers... you want to know immediately if you have seen a 
pair of numbers that sum to 225.
