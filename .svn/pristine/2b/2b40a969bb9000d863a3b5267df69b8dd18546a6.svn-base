Networking 
• What do we expect out of networking? 
– An channel between two processes on two 
remote machines. 
 
 
 
• Making this happen is complex!

• Hosts 
• Routers 
• Various Links 
• Applications 
• Protocols 
• Hardware 
• Software 
• Bit errors 
• Packet errors 
• Link failures 
• Node failures 
• Message delays 
• Out-of-order delivery 
• Eavesdropping 
Protocols 
• A protocol is a message format and rules for 
exchanging these messages. 
 
• You already use a lot of protocols: 
Networking Model: Layers of Protocols 
• A network channel is effectively only a 
transmission of 0s and 1s: 
 
 
• How do we translate these 0s and 1s into 
HTTP packets?   How do we get those to the 
right end-user?

OSI Protocol Stack / “OSI Model” 
• The “OSI Model” for networking is a 
seven layer protocol stack. 
 
• Each layer encapsulates the layers 
above it and provides specific 
features to higher-layer protocols.

Layer 1: Physical Layer 
• The Physical Layer provides 
hardware-specific details on how to 
transmit a 0 vs. 1. 
– 100BASE-T: Ethernet 
– GSM “Um Interface”: Cell phones 
– 802.11: Wi-Fi 
 
• Provides: A digital representation of 
the underlying signal; a series of 0s 
and 1s.

Application • The Data Link Layer provides link-
to-link communications. 
– Consider Wi-Fi: 
• Every computer 
that is connected 
to a wi-fi access 
point uses the same channel: every 
computer hears every other computer! 
• How do we know the data that is coming 
in is for us, not for our neighbor? 
 
• Provides: Link-to-link communications

Layer 3: Network Layer 
• The Network Layer provides host-
to-host communications. 
– One protocols: IP  (IPv4 and IPv6) 
 
• Provides: Information on the source 
and destination host. 
– Where should this packet go? 
– Who sent this packet in the first 
place?

Layer 4: Transport Layer 
• The Transport Layer provides process-to-
process communications. 
– Two main protocols: TCP and UDP 
 
• Provides: Information on the source and 
destination process… and much more. 
– Done via “network ports”, a globally shared 
resource on a system that associates a port 
number with a process. 
– The process making the connection to a 
remote process needs to know the port 
number the remote process is listening on.

TCP vs. UDP 
• TCP and UDP both provide process-to-process 
communications via port numbers. 
– That is about all UDP does.  UDP: fast and cheap! 
 
• TCP provides several convenience features: 
– Reliable Transmission: 
• Packets will arrive in the order that they were sent 
• All packets will arrive (on an active connection) 
• All packets will be delivered once (no duplicates) 
– Flow and Congestion Control: 
• TCP negotiates a rate of transmission between the 
hosts so the receiver is not overwhelmed with data
