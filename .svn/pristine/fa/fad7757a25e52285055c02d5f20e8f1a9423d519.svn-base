Speedup 
• One of the greatest advantages of parallelism 
is  to speed up computation.  We formally 
define this speedup as: 
 
– P: The number of processors 
– SP: The speedup for a given number of processors 
– T1: The execution time of a sequential algorithm 
– TP: The execution time of a parallel algorithm on P 
processors 
 
• Ideal Speedup:

Scheduling 
• When do we need scheduling?

Scheduling 
• Basic scheduling decision: 
High-Level Scheduling Example 
• Processes: 
 
 
 
• Schedule:

Scheduling Goals 
• Throughput: 
 
 
• Latency: 
 
 
• Fairness: 
Quantitative Metrics 
• Waiting Time: 
 
 
• Turnaround Time: 
 
 
• Response Time: 
FCFS: First Come First Serve 
• FCFS: Schedule tasks in the order they arrived 
at the scheduler.

SJF: Shortest Job First 
• SJF: Scheduling the job with the shortest 
running time first (non-preemptive).

PRI: Fixed Priority Scheduling 
• PRI: Schedule the job with the highest priority 
first.   (Low number  Higher priority)

Scheduling Example 
• Initially, two processes in the scheduler: 
– P1( duration = 4, priority = 1, arrival = 0 ) 
– P2( duration = 100, priority = 100, arrival = 0 ) 
 
• Every three seconds, a new process arrives: 
– Px( duration = 4, priority = 1, arrival = 0 )

• SJF: 
• PRI: 
Starvation 
• A scheduling algorithm may cause starvation 
if, for any job, it cannot guarantee that the job 
will run within a finite about of time. 
– This is not deadlock!
