Today’s announcements:
How do we get from here to there?
Need:
1.  Common Vocabulary
2. Graph implementation
3. Traversal
4. Algorithms.
Algorithm BFS(G)
     Input: graph G
     Output:  labeling of the edges of G 
as discovery edges and cross edges
For all u in G.vertices()
   setLabel(u, UNVISITED)
For all e in G.edges()
   setLabel(e, UNEXPLORED)
For all v in G.vertices()
   if getLabel(v) = UNVISITED
      BFS(G,v)
Algorithm BFS(G,v)
     Input: graph G and start vertex v
     Output:  labeling of the edges of G in the connected 
component of v as discovery edges and cross edges
queue q;
setLabel(v, VISITED)
q.enqueue(v);
While !(q.isEmpty)
   q.dequeue(v)
   For all w in G.adjacentVertices(v)
        if getLabel(w) = UNVISITED
              setLabel((v,w),DISCOVERY)
              setLabel(w, VISITED)
              q.enqueue(w)
        else if getLabel((v,w)) = UNEXPLORED
              setLabel((v,w),CROSS)

as discovery edges and back edges
For all u in G.vertices()
   setLabel(u, UNVISITED)
For all e in G.edges()
   setLabel(e, UNEXPLORED)
For all v in G.vertices()
   if getLabel(v) = UNVISITED
      DFS(G,v)
Algorithm DFS(G,v)
     Input: graph G and start vertex v
