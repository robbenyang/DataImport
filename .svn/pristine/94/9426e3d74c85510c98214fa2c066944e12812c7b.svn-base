Load Factor:  
Collision handling  Strategies 
• Separate Chaining  
• Each location in array is linked list of keys 
• How does insert, find and remove work?

What happens after remove?  
How to maintain load factor? 
Probe based hashing – 2 problems… 
Finds after removals: 
k4, V 
k5, V2 
k7, V 
k2, V9 
k3, V5 
k1, V 
remove(key2) 
find(key4) (hashes to 4) 
find(key2) 
What is cluster? 
When do set location back to empty?  
Hash table performance:  expected # of probes for Find(key) under SUHA 
Linear probing -  
Double hashing -

unsuccessful: 
½ (1 + 1/(1-α))

Separate chaining -

Open vs Closed hashing 
 
• Separate chaining is an example of open hashing: the 
actual objects live “outside" the hash table 
•Variants use different data structures as the buckets 
 
• Linear probing is an example of closed hashing: the 
objects live inside the hash table (array) itself 
• Variants use non-linear probing strategies; this is in 
hopes to disperse the keys more throughout the table 
and avoid clustering 
 
• Which would you use for large key, value pairs? 
• Which has faster structural speed? 
 
Miscellaneous Discussion –  
Which hash table implementation is better? 
•Big records –   
 
•Structure speed –  
 
What structures do hash tables replace for us? 
 
 
 
Why do we talk about balanced BST if hashing is so great? 
 
 
 
Applications of hashing?   
Area of active research in mathematics to develop general purpose hash functions. 
Interview questions! 
Consider a stream of integers... you want to know immediately if the stream stops 
producing unique values.
