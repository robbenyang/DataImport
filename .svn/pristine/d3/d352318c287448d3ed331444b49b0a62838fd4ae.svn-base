CS 241 Machine Problem Exam  Fall 2013 
 
 
 
 
Example Problem: This is an example MP exam problem to show the format of the problems.  The 
actual problems will involve system concepts coming from a list of topics that will be available on Piazza. 
 
 
 
MP Description 
Consider a program that must calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.  Recall from high school or discrete 
math that the n-th Fibonacci number, Fn, is defined (recursively) as: 
   Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 
   F1 = 1 
   F0 = 0 
 
You will find we have already pre-populated your home directory with files for this MP.  This includes 
mpx.c, the only file which you should modify.  Inside mpx.c, you will find a single function: 
   int fibonacci(int n) 
 
The int n argument is the Fibonacci number you should calculate.  You must return the result as an 
integer from the function. 
 
 
MP Requirements 
To complete this MP, you must: 
 Compute the n-th Fibonacci number 
 Return the Fibonacci number you calculated from your function 
 
Additionally, in computing the Fibonacci number, your program must not re-compute any Fibonacci 
number it has computed in the past.  That is, a first call to fibonacci(19) may take some time to 
compute, but a subsequent call to fibonacci(19), or fibonacci(9) since it’s a sub-problem of 19,  
should return instantaneously. 
 
You can assume that the maximum Fibonacci number you will be asked to compute will be less than 
1000. 
 
 
MP Testing 
To test your program, run the following commands in a terminal window inside your MP directory: 
   $ make clean 
   $ make 
   $ ./mpx 
 
You can find the test cases that the “./mpx” command is running on your MP in tester.c.  You can 
edit this file to add new test cases, but this file will not be used when we do the final grading of your MP. 
 
 
MP Submission 
To submit your MP, make sure your mpx.c file remains in the location you found it.  We will grab the file 
from your home directory.
