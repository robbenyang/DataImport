SHA2 
• SHA2 is a public algorithm 
– Security in the mathematics, not in keeping the 
implementation a secret 
Process the entire message, 64 times. 
SHA2 
• Right now, SHA2 is considered a secure hash. 
– Mathematics have not been broken 
– The complexity of reversing a hash would take 
more computing power than has ever been 
created 
 
– SHA2 has several variants based on the length of 
the output desired: SHA-256 (256-bit output) is 
most common. 
Other Algorithms 
• MD5 (1991): 
– 2005-2008: MD5 was mathematically simplified and 
available processing power could fake hashes 
– “should be considered cryptographically broken and 
unsuitable for further use” 
 
• SHA-0 (1993): 
– 1998: Was shown to be easily simplified; some hashes 
can be reversed in less than an hour! 
 
• SHA-1 (1995): 
– Replacement to concerns about SHA-0 
– 2005: Theoretical attack developed showing some 
weakness in the mathematics (reverse in <= 269) 
Sharing a Secret 
• Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange 
– Secure algorithm with large numbers 
– Demonstrates the basics of how SSL works 
 
• Setup: 
– Two parties: Alice and Bob 
– Alice and Bob both agree on a prime number p 
and a primitive root of p called g. 
Alice 
• p = 23 
• g = 5 
Bob 
• p = 23 
• g = 5
