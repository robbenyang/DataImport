TCP vs UDP 
• TCP 
– Reliable Delivery 
– Flow Control 
– Slower / More Overhead 
 
– Requires a 3-way 
handshake on connect 
 
– Ideal for applications 
where data integrity is 
critical. 
 
 
 
 
• UDP 
– Fast / Low Overhead  
– No delivery guarantees 
 
 
– “Connectionless”: no 
setup required 
 
– Ideal for applications 
where speed is most 
important. 
 
 
…and both provides for port numbers. 
• socket(): create an endpoint for communication  
• getaddrinfo(): network address and service 
translation  
 
• Server Sockets: 
– bind(): bind a name to a socket  
– listen(): listen for connections on a socket  
– accept(): accept a connection on a socket  
 
• Client Sockets: 
– connect(): initiate a connection on a socket
